      <h1 class="section-header">What is PAH?</h1>

      <div class="section-body">
        <p>
          PAH is the medical abbreviation for
          <strong>pulmonary arterial hypertension</strong>. PAH causes the
          millions of tiny blood vessels in your lungs to thicken and narrow.
          This makes it difficult for blood to flow from your heart through your
          lungs, creating high blood pressure in the lung vessels. As blood flow
          through the lungs is reduced, your lungs don’t receive enough oxygen.
          The pressure in the lungs causes the right side of the heart to work
          harder than normal.

      <div class="section-body">
        <p>
          <strong>PH</strong>, which stands for
          <strong>pulmonary hypertension</strong>, is a more general term used
          to describe any condition in which the blood pressure of the vessels
          in your lungs is too high, such as chronic lung disease, heart disease
          or chronic blood clots. Pulmonary <strong>arterial</strong>
          hypertension (PAH) is a rare type of PH that causes the pressure in
          the pulmonary arteries to rise.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>PAH is a serious disease that gets worse over time</strong>.
          Whether you're undiagnosed or already on treatment, it's important to
          talk with your doctor about the symptoms you're experiencing—and the
          activities that trigger them—so that he/she can assess your condition
          correctly and treat it the best way for you.

          Early on, you may notice these symptoms of PAH during physical
          activity. As the disease progresses, symptoms can happen even at rest.

        <p>
          Because PAH gets worse over time, it’s important to have an honest
          conversation with your doctor about how you’re really feeling,

      <div class="section-body">
        <p>
          Diagnosing PAH can be hard because it is rare and has a lot of the
          same symptoms as more common diseases or conditions. While some cases
          are passed down through family, many people with PAH don't know the
          cause of their disease. If you have symptoms of PAH, your doctor may
          conduct specific tests to assess for PAH, including:

        <p>
          While the tests help your doctor better understand your condition, the
          only way to actually confirm that you have PAH is for your doctor to
          perform a <strong>right-heart catheterization (RHC)</strong> to
          measure the pressures in your heart and the arteries in your lungs. A
          RHC also measures how much blood your heart pumps through your lungs
          and the resistance in the blood vessels in your lungs. It is not only
          an important measure of how severe your PAH is, but also helps guide
          treatment decisions, and helps identify other issues that may be
          adding to your symptoms.

          one of the most common tests to determine your ability to exercise. It

          activities – specifically, those activities that cause you to
          experience symptoms of PAH, such as shortness of breath, fatigue or
