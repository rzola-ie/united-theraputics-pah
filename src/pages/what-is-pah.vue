          PAH is the medical abbreviation for
          <strong>pulmonary arterial hypertension</strong>. PAH causes the
          millions of tiny blood vessels in your lungs to thicken and narrow.
          This makes it difficult for blood to flow from your heart through your
          lungs, creating high blood pressure in the lung vessels. As blood flow
          through the lungs is reduced, your lungs don’t receive enough oxygen.
          The pressure in the lungs causes the right side of the heart to work
          harder than normal.

          <strong>PH</strong>, which stands for
          <strong>pulmonary hypertension</strong>, is a more general term used
          to describe any condition in which the blood pressure of the vessels
          in your lungs is too high, such as chronic lung disease, heart disease
          or chronic blood clots. Pulmonary <strong>arterial</strong>
          hypertension (PAH) is a rare type of PH that causes the pressure in
          the pulmonary arteries to rise.

          <strong>PAH is a serious disease that gets worse over time</strong>.

          activities that trigger them—so that he/she can assess your condition

        <p>
          Diagnosing PAH can be hard because it is rare and has a lot of the
          same symptoms as more common diseases or conditions. While some cases
          are passed down through family, many people with PAH don't know the
          cause of their disease. If you have symptoms of PAH, your doctor may
          conduct specific tests to assess for PAH, including:

        <p>
          While the tests help your doctor better understand your condition, the
          only way to actually confirm that you have PAH is for your doctor to
          perform a <strong>right-heart catheterization (RHC)</strong> to
          measure the pressures in your heart and the arteries in your lungs. A
          RHC also measures how much blood your heart pumps through your lungs
          and the resistance in the blood vessels in your lungs. It is not only
          an important measure of how severe your PAH is, but also helps guide
          treatment decisions, and helps identify other issues that may be
          adding to your symptoms.

          minutes. This is one of the most common tests to determine your
          ability to exercise. It is an important test for people with PAH and
          is often conducted on a regular basis.

          Another measure of PAH severity is determined by your

          determine your FC based on the information you share about your daily
          activities – specifically, those activities that cause you to
          experience symptoms of PAH, such as shortness of breath, fatigue or
          fainting. There are 4 functional classes, ranging from least severe
          (Class I) to most severe (Class IV).
