        Managing Your PAH and Impact on Life Expectancy
      </h1>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>
          Once you have been diagnosed with PAH, your doctor can assess your
          <g-link to="/pah-life-expectancy#risk-prognosis/">risk status</g-link>
          to set treatment goals, and guide you on how best to manage your
          condition. Studies show that patients who optimize their therapy early
          on and lower their risk status may have a better prognosis, or
          long-term outcomes, including life expectancy.

        What is risk status<br />(and your prognosis)?

      <p class="lead">
        You're likely familiar with your
        <g-link to="/what-is-pah#functional-class/">functional class</g-link>
        and other tests that describe the status of your PAH today. But most
        people also want to know how their PAH will impact them in the future.
        PAH experts now know how to use the information about your functional
        class and <strong>6-minute walk test</strong>, along with other test
        results, to determine how PAH may affect you in the next 5 years – it's
        called <strong>risk status</strong>. Risk status goes beyond determining
        how PAH is affecting you today and helps your doctor assess the chance
        that your PAH will get worse in the future.
      </p>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>
          There are 3 levels of risk: low, intermediate and high. If you're
          <strong>low risk</strong> today, that means there's a low chance of
          your PAH getting worse. If you're <strong>intermediate</strong> or
          <strong>high risk</strong>, there is a higher chance that your PAH
          will get worse. Your doctor may consider adjusting your dose or adding
          a new medicine to improve your risk status.

            PAH experts now know that by continuing to monitor your condition
            and assess your risk status, they can work to optimize your
            treatment plan. Below are 3 of the most common assessments used to
            help evaluate your risk status. Click on each assessment to learn
            more about what it measures and how the results can help in

            Keep in mind that your doctor will use these, as well as a

          It's important for you to be clear and honest with your doctor about
          your symptoms and to discuss treatment goals that will help improve

          to walk further without feeling short of breath.

          To help meet your treatment goals, your doctor will determine the

          in your body, and studies have shown that treating PAH with only one

          The key to staying on top of your disease is to find a treatment plan
          that helps
          <strong>
            reduce your symptoms, increases your ability to exercise, helps you
            feel better, and improves your long-term prognosis</strong
          >. Your doctor will monitor your test results, but you're the one who
          will really know how you're doing day-to-day. It's helpful to use a
          journal to keep track of your symptoms, along with the activities that
          seems to trigger them. That way, at your next visit, you can tell your
          doctor how you've <i>really</i> been feeling so your care team can
          better understand how you are <i>really</i> doing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Remember, when it comes to PAH, you may need more than one medicine to
          help control your symptoms and keep your disease from getting worse.
          <strong>
            Ask your doctor about a
            <g-link to="/pah-treatment-medicine/">treatment plan</g-link>
            that helps you feel better so you can do more.
