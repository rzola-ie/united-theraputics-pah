          Many people with PAH deal with symptoms that impact their day-to-day
          lives, such as shortness of breath and fatigue. You may experience
          these symptoms because PAH causes the millions of tiny blood vessels
          in your lungs to thicken and narrow, making it difficult for blood to
          flow from your heart through your lungs. This puts extra strain on
          your heart, which makes it harder to pump blood to your lungs.
        </p>

        <p>
          PAH is a severe disease that gets worse over time. But some of todayâ€™s
          medicines have been shown to
          <strong>slow disease progression and improve how you feel</strong>. By
          working closely with your doctor to assess your

          and
          <g-link to="/pah-treatment-medicine">treatment options</g-link>, you
          may be better able to manage the impact of PAH on your life. Together
          with the support of your healthcare team, there may be more you can do
          to achieve your treatment goals.

        Even if your doctor is satisfied that you're doing "okay" with your PAH,
        is doing "okay" enough for you? There may be ways to reduce your
        symptoms so you can feel better and do more. As ongoing research helps
        us understand more about PAH, experts continue to improve the way they
        treat it.

      <div class="section-body">
        <p>
          In order to determine the best treatment approach for you, it is
          important to have your doctor regularly monitor your

          (the risk of your PAH getting worse over the next 5 years). Your
          doctor will consider a number of factors to determine whether you are
          at low-, intermediate- or high-risk status.
