        Managing Your PAH and Impact on Life Expectancy
      </h1>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>
          Once you have been diagnosed with PAH, your doctor can assess your
          <u>risk status</u> to set treatment goals, and guide you on how best
          to manage your condition. Studies show that patients who maximize
          their therapy early on and lower their risk status may have a better
          prognosis, or long-term outcomes, including life expectancy.

      <h1 class="section-header">What is risk status (and your prognosis)?</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        You’re likely familiar with your <u>functional class</u> and other tests
        that describe the status of your PAH today. But most people also want to
        know how their PAH will impact them in the future. PAH experts now know
        how to use the information about your functional class and 6-minute walk
        test, along with other test results, to determine how PAH may affect you
        in the next 5 years – it’s called <strong>risk status</strong>. Risk status goes beyond
        determining how PAH is affecting you today and helps your doctor assess
        the chance that your PAH will get worse in the future.
      </p>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>
          There are 3 levels of risk: low, intermediate and high. If you’re
          <strong>low risk</strong> today, that means there’s a low chance of
          your PAH getting worse. If you’re <strong>intermediate</strong> or
          <strong>high risk</strong>, there is a higher chance that your PAH
          will get worse. Your doctor may consider adjusting your dose or adding
          a new medicine to improve your risk status.
          <strong
            >The goal is to improve your risk status today to lower the chance
            of your disease getting worse in the future.</strong

            PAH experts now know that by continuing to monitor your condition and
            assess your risk status, they can work to optimize your treatment
            plan. Below are 3 of the most common assessments used to help evaluate
            your risk status. Click on each assessment to learn more about what it
            measures and how the results can help in assessing your risk status.

      </h1>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>
          It’s important for you to be clear and honest with your doctor about
          your symptoms and to discuss treatment goals that will help improve
          them. For example, you may want to set a specific goal of being able
          to walk further without feeling short of breath.
        </p>

        <p>
          To help meet your treatment goals, your doctor will determine the
          appropriate treatment approach for you. PAH is associated with an
          <u>imbalance of three natural substances</u> in your body, and studies
          have shown that treating PAH with only one type of medication might
          not be enough.

          The key to staying on top of your disease is to find a treatment plan
          that helps reduce your symptoms, increases your ability to exercise,
          helps you feel better, and improves your long-term prognosis and life
          expectancy – that is, one that gives you the best chance of doing
          better in the future. Your doctor will monitor your test results, but
          you’re the one who will really know how you’re doing day-to-day. It’s
          helpful to use a journal to keep track of your symptoms, along with
          the activities that seems to trigger them. That way, at your next
          visit, you can tell your doctor how you’ve really been feeling so your
          care team can better understand how your are <i>really</i> doing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Remember, when it comes to PAH, you may need more than one medicine to
          help control your symptoms and keep your disease from getting worse.
          Ask your doctor about a <u>treatment plan</u> that helps you feel
          better so you can do more.

          An important part of living well with PAH is creating a strong network

          experience of others who have learned to effectively manage this
          condition. With a bit of patience, planning, and flexibility, many
          people affected by PAH find ways to work, travel, exercise, and do
          some of the things they loved before they were diagnosed. Along with
          your doctor, your treatment care team may include:
