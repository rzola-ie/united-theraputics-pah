        <p>When you have PAH, being “stable” or “feeling okay” may seem good enough. After a while, some people may accept the idea that they’ll never feel better or get closerto the life they had before PAH. But you don’t have to accept “good enough.” <strong>Prostacyclin-class medicines</strong> have been shown to be an effective PAH treatmentoption to reduce symptoms, increase 6-minute walk distance, reduce hospitalizations, slow disease progression and improve your functional class, which means you may be able to feel better and do more. </p>

      <div class="section-body">
        <p><strong>Prostacyclin (pros-tuh-sahy-klin)</strong>—or “PCY”—is a natural substance in your body that works in different ways within the blood vessels. PCY is essential to help your lungs function properly. Normal PCY levels help maintain blood vessel health, keeping them open and allowing normal blood flow. Prostacyclin also helps prevent clotting, and slows down rapid cell growth (called proliferation), which prevents blood vessels from becoming too thick.</p>
        <p><strong>People with PAH may not produce enough natural prostacyclin</strong>. When you have too little prostacyclin, the vessels of the lungs become narrow and restrict blood flow. That’s why your doctor may consider prescribing a <u>Prostacyclin-class medicine</u>.</p>

      <div class="section-body">
        <p>Prostacyclin-class medicines target the prostacyclin pathway and mimic some of the effects of natural prostacyclin that your body lacks, to help the blood vessels in your lungs stay open. They may help prevent blood platelets from clumping together (forming clots), which can also narrow blood vessels in the lungs.</p>

        <p><strong>Prostacyclin-class medicines may work by:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Widening or opening the blood vessels (known as vasodilation)</li>
          <li>Slowing down the vessel thickening process</li>
          <li>Preventing clotting (clotting can narrow blood vessels)</li>
          <li>Smoothing the cell lining, which can help prevent the vessel from becoming too thick</li>

          <li>Improve the ability to exercise</li>

        <p>As with many medications, you may experience side effects with prostacyclins. The most common side effects of this class of medicine include headache, diarrhea, flu-like symptoms, jaw pain, muscle spasm, flushing, and nausea. PAH specialists are familiar with these expected side effects and know how to manage them.</p>
        <p>Talk to your doctor about the expected side effects before you start taking prostacyclin therapy. You will be better prepared and know what to do if they do occur. Tell your healthcare team if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.</p>
